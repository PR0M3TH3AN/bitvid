# Contributing to bitvid

Thanks for helping build an open video ecosystem on nostr!

## License Model

- **App** (this repo): GPL-3.0-or-later
- **Potential SDKs/embeds** (if split later): Apache-2.0 (to keep integration friction low)

All contributions to this repository are made under the repository’s license (GPL-3.0-or-later).

## Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO)

We use the DCO to keep contributions simple and legally sound. Sign your commits with `-s`:

```bash
git commit -s -m "feat: add cool thing"
```

This adds a `Signed-off-by: Your Name <you@example.com>` line and certifies you have the right to contribute under the project license.
See [https://developercertificate.org/](https://developercertificate.org/) for the full text.

## (Optional) Contributor License Agreement (CLA)

If we later introduce **dual-licensing** options (e.g., commercial licenses for enterprises), we may add an *optional* CLA for contributors who want to grant relicense rights. You will be asked to agree explicitly in any PR that requires it. We will keep community use under GPL-3.0-or-later.

## Code Guidelines

* Prefer small, focused PRs.
* Add tests where reasonable; keep UI accessible.
* Follow existing formatting/lint rules.
* Update docs and user-facing text when behavior changes.

## Security

If you find a vulnerability, please email **[security@bitvid.network](mailto:security@bitvid.network)**. We’ll coordinate a responsible disclosure window before public release.

## Trademark

The **bitvid** name and logos are trademarks (see `TRADEMARKS.md`). Don’t use them in ways that imply official sponsorship or confuse users. “Powered by bitvid” attribution is encouraged.
