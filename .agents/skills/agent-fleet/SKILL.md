description: Use fleet-mcp tools for backlog, mailbox, landing queue, and area ownership. Do not use it to start sessions or push main.

Follow the fleet rules in `AGENTS.md`. Call the `agent-fleet` MCP tools for backlog, mailbox, landing-queue, area questions, and commits. Editing those files directly is also fine. Sandboxed Codex cannot write Git's index: use the `commit` tool (or `fleet commit -m "..." --area <id> -- <paths>`), not `git commit`. `submit: true` queues the landing and starts a drain. Go back to work. At your next natural checkpoint, `land_status` (or `fleet landq status <id>`) can report that submission. Waiting is optional. Do not infer the lander or the land result from silence. Other providers may use either commit path.

If you installed this fleet, you stay on as the interpreter. Read `docs/agents/prompts/interpreter.md`. Run `fleet up` yourself. Talk to the session manager with `tell` and read replies with `hear`. Do not scrape the tmux pane, and do not send the user to a terminal. A routine yes you relay counts. Money, pushes, deploys, deletes, secrets, outgoing messages, and a bigger structural or directional change go to the user. Uncommitted setup files use `setup_commit`, not `git commit`. Workers do not start the fleet. `fleet crontab` stays unused unless the user asks.

You may use this harness's own subagents for parallel research, investigation, test runs, or review. You coordinate edits in a worktree so subagents do not edit the same files at the same time. Landing still goes through your `commit` and the queue.

To update the kit: `git pull` in `~/agent-fleet-kit`, reinstall, run `fleet update`, and restart agents after handoff if it says so. Do not re-run init to upgrade.
