# Release Draft - 2026-01-31

## Highlights

### Webseed Stability (Unstable)

A recent change aimed at fixing a webseed regression was reverted (PR #2002) to ensure stability in the unstable channel. This restores the previous behavior while a more robust fix is investigated.

### Major Repository Update (Main)

The main branch has received a significant update (`b429b1c`), incorporating extensive changes across the codebase. This synchronization brings `main` up to date with the latest developments.

## Upgrade Notes

No specific manual migration steps are required, but developers should be aware of the large changeset in `main`.
