Timestamp: 2026-02-18_15-00-00
Branch: agents/daily/scheduler-update-agent
Agent: scheduler-update-agent

## Goal
Keep the daily and weekly scheduler rosters in sync with the actual prompt files on disk.

## Scope
- `/docs/agents/prompts/daily/`
- `/docs/agents/prompts/weekly/`
- `/docs/agents/prompts/daily-scheduler.md`
- `/docs/agents/prompts/weekly-scheduler.md`

## Assumptions
- `daily-scheduler.md` and `weekly-scheduler.md` are the sources of truth for the roster.
- `.md` files in `daily/` and `weekly/` define the available agents.
- The rosters should list all available agents.

## Constraints
- Only modify the roster table.
- Do not modify prompt files.
- Preserve alphabetical order.
