# Docs Code Investigator: js/services/playbackService.js

**Date:** 2026-02-13
**Target:** `js/services/playbackService.js` (1288 lines)
**Reason:** Critical core service for video playback, implementing the hybrid URL/Magnet strategy. High complexity, high value for documentation.
**Last Significant Commit:** 05d575d187e5dbc4628271bb289981acbc20c7cd (docs alignment)

## Plan

1.  **Analyze**: Read the full file to understand state management, playback flow, error handling, and integration with `bitvidApp` and `nostr`.
2.  **Document**:
    *   Add JSDoc for all exported methods.
    *   Add flow comments for the main `playVideo` sequence.
    *   Identify key invariants (e.g., magnet handling, player initialization).
    *   Create `docs/playbackService-overview.md` to explain the hybrid strategy in detail.
3.  **Verify**: Run `npm run lint` and `npm run test:unit`.
