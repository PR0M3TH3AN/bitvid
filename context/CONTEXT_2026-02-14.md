# Context - Content Audit Agent 2026-02-14

## Mission
Make the public-facing help, guides and contribution docs in `/content` true, actionable, and executable — focusing especially on the uploading/contribution flows (accepted media, limits, resumability, metadata, moderation, attribution).

## Scope
- Docs: `content/`
- Code: `js/` (especially upload/playback logic), `config/`
- Goal: Align `/content` with actual code behavior.

## Metadata
- Date: 2026-02-14
- Agent: bitvid-content-audit-agent (via daily scheduler)
