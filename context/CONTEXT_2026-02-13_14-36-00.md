## Plan

1. Analyze `js/services/playbackService.js` to understand its public API, internal state machine, and fallback logic.
2. Add JSDoc comments to exported classes and methods.
3. Add inline comments to clarify complex sections (e.g., `playVideoWithFallback`, state transitions).
4. Create `docs/playbackService-overview.md` to document the architecture and usage.
5. Verify changes with lint and tests.
