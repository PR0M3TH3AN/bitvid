# Context for InnerHTML Migration

**Agent:** innerhtml-migration-agent
**Date:** 2026-02-13
**Scope:** Identify and migrate one file with innerHTML usage to safe DOM APIs.

**Chosen File:** `js/channelProfile.js`
**Reason:** Identified as a high-count file (10 assignments) in the `check-innerhtml` report.

**Plan:**
1.  Analyze all 10 `innerHTML` assignments.
2.  Replace `innerHTML = ""` with `textContent = ""`.
3.  Replace static HTML strings with `createElement` / `appendChild` or `textContent`.
4.  Replace templated strings with `createElement` and safe text setting.
5.  Verify with lint and tests.
6.  Update baseline.
