# Context: Documenting PlaybackService

**Agent:** docs-code-investigator
**Target:** `js/services/playbackService.js` (~1300 lines)

## Selection Reason
This file is the core orchestrator for the "Hybrid Playback Strategy" (URL first, then P2P). It contains complex state machine logic for fallback, race condition handling via request signatures, and watchdog monitoring. It is critical for the user experience and maintainability.

## Plan
1. **Analyze:** Understand the flow of `PlaybackSession.execute()`.
2. **Document:**
   - Add JSDoc to `PlaybackService` and its public methods.
   - Add JSDoc to the internal `PlaybackSession` class (as it's the return value).
   - Add a high-level flow comment to the top of the file.
   - Add comments inside `execute()` to clarify the decision tree.
3. **Overview:** Create `docs/playbackService-overview.md` detailing the fallback logic and state machine.
4. **Verify:** Run lint and unit tests.

## Constraints
- No behavioral changes.
- No crypto changes.
- Existing tests must pass.
