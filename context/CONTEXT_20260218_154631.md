# Documentation Plan: js/nostr/nip71.js

## Selection
- **File**: `js/nostr/nip71.js`
- **Lines**: 1530
- **Reason**:
  - Large Nostr helper file (>1500 LOC).
  - Handles core domain logic for Video Events (NIP-71), which is critical for BitVid.
  - Memory indicates it differs from other event builders (defined separately), making it a source of confusion.
  - Likely contains complex logic for validation, parsing, and construction of video events.
- **Last Significant Commit**: f22253f5601669dc4a4475a0f350c59aa39bdc52 (2026-02-18) - touched by perf-agent but likely not fully documented.

## Plan
1.  **Analyze**: Read the file to understand its exports, flows, and dependencies.
2.  **Document**:
    - Add file-level overview comment.
    - Add JSDoc to all exported functions (builders, parsers, validators).
    - Document internal helper functions where necessary.
    - Create `docs/nip71-overview.md` if the logic is complex enough (likely yes, given 1.5k LOC).
3.  **Verify**: Run `npm run test:unit` and `npm run lint`.
