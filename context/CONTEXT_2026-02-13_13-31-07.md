# Docs Code Investigator - Context

- **Agent**: docs-code-investigator
- **Date**: 2026-02-13
- **Target File**: `js/ui/profileModalController.js` (8158 lines)
- **Reason**: This is the largest source file in the repository (excluding `js/nostr/client.js` which has some docs). It is a critical UI component handling profile management, moderation, and settings, but appears to lack high-level documentation.
- **Plan**:
  - Analyze the file's structure and public API.
  - Document the `ProfileModalController` class with JSDoc.
  - Add flow comments for major interactions (e.g., saving profile, switching tabs).
  - Create `docs/profileModalController-overview.md` to explain its role and interactions.
  - Verify changes with lint and unit tests.
