# Context

## Goal
Improve application responsiveness by optimizing background tasks and ensuring documentation accuracy.

## Scope
-   Analyze codebase for performance bottlenecks (timers, loops, concurrency).
-   Fix: Visibility-gate `VideoEventBuffer` to prevent UI thrashing when hidden.
-   Audit: Verify upload documentation matches implementation.

## Assumptions
-   `document.hidden` is reliable.
-   `VideoEventBuffer` is the primary feed ingestion path.

## Definition of Done
-   `VideoEventBuffer` pauses UI updates when hidden.
-   `daily-perf-report` generated.
-   Lint passes.
