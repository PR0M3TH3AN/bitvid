# Context: Documenting ProfileModalController

**Target File:** `js/ui/profileModalController.js`
**Lines:** ~8158
**Selection Reason:**
- Extremely large file implementing critical UI logic (profile management, moderation, DMs).
- Contains complex state management and sub-controller orchestration.
- Limited test coverage found (`tests/ui/profileModalController-addProfile.test.mjs`).
- Explicitly mentioned in `AGENTS.md` as a candidate for refactoring (documentation is the first step).

**Goal:**
- Analyze the file structure and public API.
- Add JSDoc to the `ProfileModalController` class and its main public methods.
- Add inline comments to complex logic sections (e.g., authentication, saving).
- Create `docs/profileModalController-overview.md` to document flows and integration points.
- Verify with linting and unit tests.
