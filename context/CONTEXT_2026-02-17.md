# Context - Perf Agent - 2026-02-17

## Goal
Improve application responsiveness by bounding concurrency in background network tasks, specifically for DM signal events and DM service operations.

## Scope
- `js/nostr/dmSignalEvents.js`: Fix unbounded `Promise.all` in `publishDmReadReceipt` and `publishDmTypingIndicator`.
- `js/services/dmNostrService.js`: Fix unbounded `Promise.all` in `connect` and `publishSignedEvent`.
- `content/docs/guides/upload-content.md`: Fix documentation port number (5500 -> 3000).

## Assumptions
- `pMap` utility works as expected.
- `RELAY_BACKGROUND_CONCURRENCY` (3) is an appropriate limit for these operations.

## Definition of Done
- All `Promise.all` usages in targeted functions are replaced with `pMap` with concurrency limits.
- `npm run lint` passes.
- `npm run test:dm:unit` passes.
- `npm run test:dm:integration` passes.
- `content/docs/guides/upload-content.md` is updated.
