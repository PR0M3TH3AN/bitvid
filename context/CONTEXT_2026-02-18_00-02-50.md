# Context: Content Audit & Bug Fix

**Agent:** content-audit-agent
**Date:** 2026-02-18
**Goal:** Audit `content/docs/guides/upload-content.md` against codebase. Fix identified bug in NIP-71 hashtag handling.

## Scope
- `content/docs/guides/upload-content.md`
- `js/services/videoNotePayload.js`
- `js/ui/components/UploadModal.js`
- `components/upload-modal.html`

## Identified Issue
Hashtags entered in the Upload Modal are collected as `{ t: [...] }` by `Nip71FormManager` (due to `data-nip71-list="t"`).
However, `videoNotePayload.js`'s `normalizeNip71Metadata` only looks for `rawMetadata.hashtags`.
This causes user-entered hashtags to be dropped during payload construction.

## Plan
1. Inventory and verify all claims in `upload-content.md`.
2. Create a unit test to reproduce the hashtag bug.
3. Fix the bug in `videoNotePayload.js` to support `t` alias.
4. Verify fix with tests.
