# Docs Code Investigator Context

- **Date:** 2026-02-13
- **Agent:** docs-code-investigator
- **Target File:** `js/services/playbackService.js`
- **Line Count:** ~630 LOC (based on read_file output, though `wc` said 1288 earlier - maybe I read a different version or `wc` counts comments/blanks differently? Let me check `wc` again later. Ah, the `read_file` output seems complete but maybe shorter than I thought. Wait, scrolling up... the file content I read ends with `export default PlaybackService;`. It seems complete. 600 lines is still substantial.)
- **Reason:** Core component for Hybrid Playback Strategy, complex state machine in `PlaybackSession`, essential for app reliability. Listed in `AGENTS.md` as a key file for Playback subsystem.
- **Plan:**
    1. Analyze `js/services/playbackService.js`.
    2. Add JSDoc to `PlaybackService` and `PlaybackSession`.
    3. Document the `execute()` flow with inline comments.
    4. Create `docs/playbackService-overview.md` detailing the internal state machine and probe logic.
    5. Run lint and unit tests.
