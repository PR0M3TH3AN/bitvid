**Agent:** content-audit-agent
**Goal:** Audit user documentation in `/content` against the codebase to ensure accuracy of upload/contribution flows.

## Scope
- Documentation: `content/docs/getting-started.md`, `content/docs/guides/upload-content.md`.
- Code: `js/ui/components/UploadModal.js`, `components/upload-modal.html`, `js/services/videoNotePayload.js`, `js/storage/s3-multipart.js`.

## Assumptions
- The codebase in `js/` represents the current runtime reality.
- `docs/agents/prompts/daily/bitvid-content-audit-agent.md` instructions are the primary guide.
