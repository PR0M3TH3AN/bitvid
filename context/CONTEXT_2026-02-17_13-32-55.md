- Prioritize findings.
- Create `daily-perf-report-2026-02-17.md`
- Potentially fix 1-3 small issues.
- Audit `/content` upload docs (if relevant).

## Assumptions
- Codebase is in `unstable` state.
- Dependencies are installed.

## Definition of Done
- `perf/hits-2026-02-17.json` created.
- `daily-perf-report-2026-02-17.md` created.
