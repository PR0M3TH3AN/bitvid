# Docs Code Investigator Context

- **Target File:** `js/services/playbackService.js`
- **Lines:** ~1300
- **Reason:** Core business logic (Hybrid Playback Strategy), complex state machine involving URL fallbacks and WebTorrent, critical for user experience.
- **Goal:** Add JSDoc to all public methods, document internal flow of `execute()`, create `docs/playbackService-overview.md`.

## Plan
1. Analyze `js/services/playbackService.js` for public API surface and internal flows.
2. Add JSDoc to `PlaybackService` and `PlaybackSession` classes.
3. Add inline comments to `execute()` to explain the state transitions.
4. Create `docs/playbackService-overview.md` with flow diagrams and usage examples.
5. Verify with `npm run lint` and `npm run test:unit`.
