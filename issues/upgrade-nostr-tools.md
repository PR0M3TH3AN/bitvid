# Upgrade nostr-tools

- **Current Version:** 2.20.0
- **Wanted Version:** 2.21.0
- **Latest Version:** 2.21.0

**Status:** Skipped (Risky/Protocol)
**Reason:** This is a cryptographic/protocol library. As per security guardrails, manual review is required before upgrading. The upgrade from 2.20 to 2.21 is minor but still falls under the "anything touching nostr-tools" policy.
