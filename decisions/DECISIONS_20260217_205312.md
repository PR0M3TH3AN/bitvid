# Decisions for Constants Refactor

- **5000ms timeout in `js/subscriptions.js`**: Replaced with `SHORT_TIMEOUT_MS` from `js/constants.js`. The usage matches the definition of a "short timeout" for background operations or quick fallbacks.
- **10000ms timeout in `js/userBlocks.js`**: Replaced with `STANDARD_TIMEOUT_MS` from `js/constants.js`. The usage is for a fetch operation which aligns with the standard timeout definition.

Alternatives considered:
- Creating specific constants like `NIP07_SHORT_TIMEOUT_MS`. Rejected because `SHORT_TIMEOUT_MS` is generic enough and already used for similar purposes.
