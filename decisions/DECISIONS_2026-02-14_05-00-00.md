# Decisions: Content Audit

- **Decision:** Trust the codebase as the source of truth.
- **Decision:** If documentation matches code, no changes are needed, but artifacts must be produced to prove the audit was performed.
- **Decision:** "Recommended" limits in docs are acceptable even if not strictly enforced by server code, as they reflect client-side constraints (hashing memory).
