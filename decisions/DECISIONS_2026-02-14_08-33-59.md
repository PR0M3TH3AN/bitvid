# Decisions: Daily Dependency Audit

- **Date**: 2026-02-14

## Decision 1: Skip Auto-Upgrade of `nostr-tools`
- **Context**: `nostr-tools` has a minor update available (2.19.4 -> 2.23.1).
- **Rationale**: The agent instructions explicitly state: "Do not auto-upgrade cryptographic/protocol libraries... without maintainers’ approval."
- **Outcome**: Logged in report, no action taken.

## Decision 2: Skip Major Upgrades
- **Context**: `tailwindcss`, `stylelint`, `postcss-import`, `pixelmatch` have major updates.
- **Rationale**: Major upgrades are risky and require manual testing/migration.
- **Outcome**: Logged in report.

## Decision 3: Skip Minor DevDeps
- **Context**: `prettier-plugin-tailwindcss` has a minor update.
- **Rationale**: To keep the daily run clean and focused on reporting first, skipping minor dev dep bump for now.
- **Outcome**: Logged in report.
