# Decisions: NIP Research Agent (2026-02-18)

- **Prioritize NIP-65**: The inventory lists NIP-65 as "Partial" due to missing tests. As a P0 item (Relay Lists), this is the highest priority gap to close.
- **Test Strategy**: Create a new test file `tests/nostr-specs/nip65_compliance.test.mjs` that mocks `nostrClient` to test `relayManager` in isolation.
