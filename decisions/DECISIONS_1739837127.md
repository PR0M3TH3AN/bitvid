# Decisions

## Extraction Strategy
- Extracted logic heavily depends on `this` (the controller instance).
- To avoid modifying `ProfileDirectMessageController.js` (keeping changes confined to `ProfileModalController` decomposition), we will create "Binder" modules that export standalone functions accepting the controller instance.
- This pattern mimics the "Mixin" or "Extension Method" pattern but with pure functions.

## Naming
- `ProfileDmRelayBinder.js`: Handles relay preferences and UI binding.
- `ProfileDmAttachmentBinder.js`: Handles attachment queue rendering and uploading.

## Dependencies
- Binders will import necessary utilities (logger, helpers) but rely on the controller instance for state and services.
