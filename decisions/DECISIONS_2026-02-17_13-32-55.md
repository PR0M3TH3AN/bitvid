# Decisions: 2026-02-17 Perf Agent Run

- Starting fresh run.
- Using grep for search patterns.
- Fixed unbounded concurrency in `js/relayManager.js` by using `pMap` with `RELAY_BACKGROUND_CONCURRENCY` (3).
- Decided to ignore `lint:hex` failure on `js/webtorrent.min.js` as it is an existing issue unrelated to current changes.
