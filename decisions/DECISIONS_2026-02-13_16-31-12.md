# DECISIONS: innerHTML Migration for js/channelProfile.js

- **Zap Panel (`panel.innerHTML`)**: The HTML is static and large. Replacing it with `createElement` calls will make the code verbose. However, this is the standard way to avoid `innerHTML`. I will extract the creation logic into a helper function `createZapPanelContent` to keep the main `setupZapButton` function clean.
- **Subscribe Button**: The HTML is small. I will use `createElement`.
- **Loading/Error States**: These are simple. I will use `createElement`.
- **Clearing Content**: Using `replaceChildren()` is the modern, safe way to clear an element.

## Strategy for Zap Panel
Since the Zap Panel HTML is complex, I'll break it down into logical sections (header, form, etc.) within the helper function.

## Strategy for Subscribe Button
The button has dynamic text based on `alreadySubscribed`. I will create the button and icon elements and set their properties.
