# Decisions for Scheduler Update

Timestamp: 2026-02-18_15-00-00

## Decisions

### No Changes Needed
**Context:** The daily and weekly scheduler rosters were compared against the prompt files on disk.
**Decision:** No updates were applied to `docs/agents/prompts/daily-scheduler.md` or `docs/agents/prompts/weekly-scheduler.md` because the rosters exactly match the file inventory (21 daily, 16 weekly).

### Persistent State Refresh
**Context:** As a housekeeping agent, this run started a fresh context.
**Decision:** Created new `context/`, `todo/`, `decisions/`, and `test_logs/` files with timestamp `2026-02-18_15-00-00`.
