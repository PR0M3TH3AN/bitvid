# Test Log - Perf Agent - 2026-02-17

## Pre-fix
- [x] Lint check: Passed locally (failed in CI due to `perf/` artifacts).
- [x] DM Unit Tests: Passed.
- [x] DM Integration Tests: Passed.

## Post-fix (CI Repair)
- [x] Lint check: Passed locally with `perf/` artifacts present (after updating exclusions).
- [x] `npm run lint:hex`: Passed.

## Details
- `npm run lint` showed `vendor/webtorrent.min.js` file size warning (expected).
- `npm run test:dm:unit` passed 100%.
- `npm run test:dm:integration` passed 100%.
- CI Failure (lint:hex) was caused by `git grep` matching hex codes in `perf/hits-2026-02-17.txt` (which contained minified code dumps) and `test_logs/`. Added exclusions to `scripts/check-hex.js`.
