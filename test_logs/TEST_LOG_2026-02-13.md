# Test Log 2026-02-13

## Linting
- Command: `npm run lint:file-size`
- Result: Passed (js/services/playbackService.js is under the grandfathered limit + 50 lines).

## Unit Tests
- Command: `npx node --test tests/services/playbackService.test.mjs tests/services/playbackService_order.test.mjs tests/services/playbackService_forcedSource.test.mjs`
- Result: FAILED (12 failures).
- Note: **These failures are pre-existing.** Verified by restoring `js/services/playbackService.js` to its original state and running the same tests, which produced identical failures.
- Action: Proceeding with documentation changes as they do not affect runtime behavior.
