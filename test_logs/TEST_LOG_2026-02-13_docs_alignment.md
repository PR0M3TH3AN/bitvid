# Test Log - 2026-02-13 Docs Alignment

## Validated Commands

The following commands were verified to match the updated documentation:

- `npm ci` (Success)
- `npm run lint` (Success)
- `npm run audit` (Success, generated `REMEDIATION_REPORT.md`)

## Observations

- `npm run lint:assets` skipped because `dist/asset-manifest.json` was missing (requires build). This is expected behavior as documented ("For full coverage, run `npm run build` before linting").
- `npm run lint:sw-compat` skipped due to missing git history/HEAD^ in the sandbox environment. This is acceptable.

## Artifacts

- `REMEDIATION_REPORT.md` (Generated by `npm run audit`)
