# Nostr Analytics Knobs

BitVid's view counter emits Nostr events so operators can track engagement without duplicating storage. Tune the following exports in `config/instance-config.js` to match your retention and performance goals:

- `VIEW_COUNT_DEDUPE_WINDOW_SECONDS` (default: `86_400`): repeat plays from the same viewer inside this window are treated as duplicates so stalled reloads do not inflate totals. Shorten the window to count more aggressive replays, or extend it if you want conservative numbers.
- `VIEW_COUNT_BACKFILL_MAX_DAYS` (default: `90`): controls how far back hydrators should walk history when a new analytics worker boots. Longer windows deliver deeper trend lines at the cost of heavier relay scans.
- `VIEW_COUNT_CACHE_TTL_MS` (default: `5 * 60 * 1000`): defines how long cached aggregates remain trustworthy before clients refresh them. Lower values surface spikes faster, while higher ones smooth traffic for relay-friendly dashboards.

Most operators can ship with the defaultsâ€”24-hour deduplication, a 90-day backfill horizon, and five-minute cache TTLs match what we run in production. Deviate only if your relays have unusual load constraints or your reporting needs stricter fidelity.

## View Event Lifecycle

### Anonymous session keys

Playback telemetry runs even when a viewer has not connected a Nostr account. The client first calls [`ensureSessionActor`](../js/nostr.js#L2011-L2105) to mint or restore an ephemeral keypair stored in `localStorage`. That session actor signs view events until the user authenticates, ensuring relays still see consistent pubkeys without blocking anonymous playback.

### Publish latency expectations

When a player crosses the 12-second watch threshold, BitVid invokes [`publishViewEvent`](../js/nostr.js#L2159-L2323) through `recordVideoView`. The helper considers the publish successful as soon as any configured relay acknowledges the event, which in practice keeps latency under a second on public relays. The UI optimistically increments totals by feeding the signed event into [`ingestLocalViewEvent`](../js/viewCounter.js#L608-L640), so cards and modals reflect the new view immediately even while other relays finish syncing.

To avoid double-counting the same session, the playback stack respects the cooldown keys generated in [`js/app.js`](../js/app.js#L6825-L6893). The combination of pointer identity and viewer fingerprint prevents re-logging until the dedupe window expires or the user switches accounts.

### Hydration, COUNT, and UI sync

Background hydration keeps optimistic counts honest. The view counter subscribes to live events while simultaneously fetching historical lists and issuing a `COUNT` request. Whenever the authoritative total returned by `COUNT` exceeds the locally accumulated sum, the hydration routine overwrites the optimistic value so the UI stays aligned with relay truth. If `COUNT` falls back (because relays reject it or the browser is offline), the locally deduped history still anchors totals, and the next successful hydration pass reconciles any drift. This interplay means cards, modals, and dashboards settle on the same number without requiring a full page reload.
