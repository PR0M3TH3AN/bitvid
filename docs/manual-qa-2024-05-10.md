# Manual QA â€” 2024-05-10

## Scope
* Login/logout state transitions via `authService`
* Video list rendering and playback fallback via `playbackService`
* Upload submissions (URL only, magnet only, combined) via `publishVideoNote`

## Environment
* Local static server: `python -m http.server 5173`
* Browser automation: Playwright (Chromium) via sandboxed runner
* Stubbed `window.nostr` for extension-less login flows

## Results
### Authentication
* Pre-login upload button hidden (`False`).
* Post-login upload button visible (`True`); profile button also visible.
* Post-logout upload button hidden again (`False`).

### Playback
* Hosted URL attempt emitted `session-start` analytics event. Hosted playback errored in sandbox (no magnet fallback available for URL-only sample).
* Second sample (URL + magnet) emitted `session-start`, `fallback`, `playViaWebTorrent`, and `sourcechange: torrent` events confirming magnet fallback wiring.

### Upload flows
* URL-only submission succeeded (normalized payload kept empty magnet and blank hints).
* Magnet-only submission appended WSS tracker hints plus provided `ws`/`xs` values.
* Combined submission retained HTTPS URL and normalized magnet with tracker hints.

## Notes
Automation invoked `app.authService.login`/`handleAuthLogin` and `app.publishVideoNote` directly to simulate modal interactions. Playback checks observed console analytics, not media rendering (hosted stream blocked by sandbox security).
