**Agent:** bitvid-const-refactor-agent (via Daily Scheduler)

## Goal
Identify and refactor duplicated numeric constants in `js/` to improve maintainability and clarity.

## Scope
- Search for common numeric literals (e.g., 1000, 5000, 10000).
- Select a clear candidate group.
- Replace with a named constant in `js/constants.js` or `js/nostr/relayConstants.js`.

## Constraints
- Minimal changes.
- Must pass `npm run lint` and `npm run test:unit`.
