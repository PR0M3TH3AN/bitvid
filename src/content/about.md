# About bitvid

Welcome to bitvid, a new kind of video platform that puts you in control. Unlike traditional video sites that keep your content on their servers, bitvid lets videos flow directly between creators and viewers. Think of it like a digital potluck where everyone brings and shares content directly with each other!

## What Makes bitvid Different?

- **You're in Control**: Your videos stay yours. No company owns or controls your content – you share it directly with your viewers.
- **Always Available**: Because videos are shared between viewers, popular content actually loads faster instead of slower. No more buffering during peak times!
- **Privacy First**: No need for email or password – you log in with a secure key that only you control.
- **Support Creators Directly**: Send tips to creators you love without a platform taking a big cut.
- **Free and Open**: bitvid's code is open source, meaning anyone can check how it works or help make it better.

## How Does It Work?

bitvid uses two main technologies to make this all possible:

1. **WebTorrent**: This lets viewers stream videos directly from other viewers, like a relay race passing the content from person to person.
2. **Nostr**: This handles your login and video details, like a digital ID card that works across many sites.

## Join the Revolution

Whether you're tired of traditional platforms controlling your content, care about privacy, or just want a better way to share videos, bitvid offers a fresh alternative. Come be part of the future of video sharing!
