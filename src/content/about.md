# About bitvid: Decentralized Video Sharing

Welcome to **bitvid**, a platform where video sharing meets the power of decentralization. **bitvid** is more than just a video-sharing site—it's a groundbreaking way to share, discover, and enjoy content, leveraging the latest in blockchain, peer-to-peer, and privacy-centric technologies.

## **How Does It Work?**

At its core, **bitvid** combines two powerful technologies:

1. **WebTorrent**: This enables seamless streaming directly from peers using magnet links. Videos aren't hosted on centralized servers but are distributed across a network of peers. This ensures scalability, faster downloads, and freedom from server outages.
2. **Nostr Integration**: **bitvid** uses the Nostr protocol to manage video metadata, user authentication, and secure publishing. This means your account and content are not tied to a single platform or server. Your public key is your identity.

Together, these technologies create a decentralized and censorship-resistant platform.

## **Why is bitvid Different?**

1. **No Centralized Servers**: Traditional platforms store videos on centralized servers, giving them control over content availability. **bitvid** flips the script by allowing users to host and share videos directly with one another.

2. **Ownership and Privacy**:

   - With Nostr, you retain full control of your identity and data. No email addresses or passwords are required—your cryptographic key is your gateway.
   - Share public videos with the world or private ones encrypted for specific viewers.

3. **Open and Transparent**: **bitvid** runs on open-source code, ensuring transparency and inviting collaboration from the global community.

4. **Freedom of Speech**: Decentralization makes censorship nearly impossible. Your content belongs to you and can't be removed by external forces.

5. **Efficient and Scalable**: **bitvid**'s peer-to-peer streaming ensures that popular content becomes faster to access, not slower. The more people watch, the more efficient the network becomes.
