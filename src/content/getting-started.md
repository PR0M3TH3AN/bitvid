Welcome to **bitvid**, a decentralized platform for video sharing that puts you in control. Using cutting-edge technologies like **Nostr** and **WebTorrent**, bitvid allows creators to share, stream, and manage video content directly through peer-to-peer connections, ensuring privacy, freedom, and ownership.

## What is bitvid?

bitvid is a video-sharing platform that decentralizes content delivery:

1. **Nostr Integration**: User authentication and video metadata are managed using Nostr, a decentralized messaging protocol. Log in with a Nostr-compatible browser extension to add, edit, or remove video posts.
2. **WebTorrent Streaming**: Videos are streamed using magnet links and WebTorrent technology. This allows viewers to fetch and play video content directly from peers in their browser without central servers.

## How Does It Work?

#### For Viewers

- Simply browse the bitvid site to discover available videos.
- Click on a video to stream it directly from other peers using WebTorrent. No additional downloads are required for playback.

#### For Creators

1. **Login with Nostr**: Use a Nostr extension like Alby or Nos2x to log in. This step connects your Nostr public key to your bitvid account.
2. **Share Videos**:
   - Use the “Share a Video” form to submit a magnet link for your content.
   - Add a title, optional thumbnail, and description to make your post more engaging.
3. **Seed Your Content**:
   - Download [WebTorrent Desktop](https://webtorrent.io/desktop/).
   - Open your video file in WebTorrent Desktop to generate a magnet link and seed it. Seeding ensures your video stays available for others to download and stream.

## Key Features

1. **Complete Control Over Content**:

   - You can **edit** or **delete** your posts directly through the bitvid interface.
   - Mark videos as private, encrypting their magnet links, so only you can access them.

2. **Peer-to-Peer Streaming**:

   - Videos are streamed directly between viewers and seeders, avoiding censorship or central points of failure.

3. **Decentralized Authentication**:
   - Nostr ensures secure, decentralized login without traditional user accounts.

### Requirements for Creators

- **Nostr Extension**: Install a Nostr extension to log in and manage your content.
- **WebTorrent Desktop**: Use it to seed your video files and generate magnet links. Without seeding, your videos won’t be accessible to others.
