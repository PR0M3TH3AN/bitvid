# Release Draft - 2026-01-24

## Highlights

### S3 Multipart Upload Support
We have introduced a new helper module `js/storage/s3-multipart.js` to facilitate reliable uploads of large files to S3-compatible storage providers. This module handles:
- Multipart upload orchestration (initiate, upload parts, complete/abort).
- Automatic part sizing calculation.
- Bucket existence checks and creation (with region support).
- CORS configuration helper.
- Intelligent `Cache-Control` header generation based on file type.

This addition paves the way for more robust video upload capabilities directly to object storage.
