# TODO 2026-02-13

## Done
- [x] Analyze `js/services/playbackService.js` for complexity and coverage.
- [x] Create `docs/playbackService-overview.md` with hybrid playback strategy documentation.
- [x] Add JSDoc to `PlaybackService` and `PlaybackSession` exports.
- [x] Add flow comments to `PlaybackSession.execute`.
- [x] Verify linting (file size).
- [x] Verify unit tests (failed, but confirmed pre-existing).

## Blocked/Questions
- Unit tests for `playbackService` are failing across the board, even on unmodified code. Needs a separate investigation (possibly by `bitvid-test-audit-agent`).
